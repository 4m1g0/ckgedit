Scayt now handled internally and requires wsc.

Fixed bad filebrowser initial path by restoring tableselection plugin folder which ckeditor.js was looking for.
Same type of error occurred when I removed scayt plugin folder.  If ckeditgor misses an expected folder,
it must output the path if the mssing folder which then gets prepended to the filebrowser path.

Removed class attribute from Styles.js->Remove Block; causes type error

Note:  Font-style being removed on re-load, check pre-processor
